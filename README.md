**Background**

The mean cost of living in the United States for a family of four is approximately $7,083 per month, which equates to $85,000 per year (Upwardli, 2023). While this number may fluctuate due to location, it is important for parents to be financially capable of supporting themselves and their families. Stack Overflow posted survey results from their 2022 Developer Survey on Kaggle, which contains every recorded response from individuals with technical skill sets (Elgazar, 2023). This provided the opportunity to analyze and model dependent variables to predict if these technical individuals were able to support the mean cost of living for a family of four in the United States.

Within the 2022 Developer Survey, there are 79 attributes and 73,268 observations from respondents from around the world. For the purpose of this study, total compensation (CompTotal) will represent the independent variable. Years of professional programming (YearsCodePro), education level (EdLevel), remote work status (RemoteWork), and employer size (OrgSize) will represent dependent variables for the study. 


**Purpose**

The main purpose of this project was to practice data mining algorithms based on a relevant real-world data set. This included creating models for:

- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
